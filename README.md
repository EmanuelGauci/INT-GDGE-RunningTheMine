# INT-GDGE-RunningTheMine


branches: prototype, post prototype, final


prototype: the prototype was mainly to find the main basic functions of the game

post prototype:
- in the first parts of the post prototype stage, I was mainly focusing on producing the assets such as 3D models and music, which is also where I learned that textures are not automatically appended to a model when you export things from maya to unity
- secondly, I expanded on the gameplay mechanics, such as:
- - making the game increase speed after collecting more points
- - giving the player a head start so the player is not overwhelmed
- - implementing a high score system.
- at the later stages of the game, I decided to make the assets of the game more low poly to help optimize performance
- I changed the character from a ball to a mine cart(which unintentionally helped with many clipping errors 

final:
- I am not happy enough with the game yet to consider this a finished project
